and logic.

- [Nom](https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom)
- Artifact format documentation from the [libyal](https://github.com/libyal)
  project
- [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). See `runtime` and `core` for
  examples on embedding Deno

Resources for learning Rust:

- Official Rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

# Nom

Nom is a very popular binary parsing library. artemis makes extensive use of nom
for parsing all different kinds of binary files. If you familarize yourself with
nom and how it works then the artemis code should be much easier to understand.
