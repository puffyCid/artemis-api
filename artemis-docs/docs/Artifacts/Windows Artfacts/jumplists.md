# Jumplists

Windows `Jumplists` files track opened files via applications in the Taskbar or
Start Menu. Jumplists are actually a collection of embedded
[Shortcut](./shortcuts.md) files and therefore can show evidence of file
interaction.

There are two (2) types of Jumplist files:

- Custom - Files that are pinned to Taskbar applications
- Automatic - Files that are not pinned to Taskbar applications

Other parsers:

- [Jumplist Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/)
