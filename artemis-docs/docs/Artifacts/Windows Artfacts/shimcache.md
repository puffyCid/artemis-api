# Shimcache

Windows `Shimcache` (also called: AppCompatCache, Application Compatability
Cache, or AppCompat) are Registry entries that may<sup>*</sup> indicate
application execution. These entries are only written when the system is
shutdown or restarted.

<sup>*</sup> While an entry in Shimcache often implies the application was
executed, Windows may pre-populate Shimcache with entries based on a user
browsing to a directory that contains an application.

```

# Collection Options

- `alt_file` Full path to alternative SYSTEM Registry file. This configuration
  is **optional**. By default artemis will parse the SYSTEM Registry file at the
  default location.

# Output Structure

An array of `Shimcache` entries

```typescript
export interface Shimcache {
  /**Entry number for shimcache. Entry zero (0) is most recent execution */
  entry: number;
  /**Full path to application file */
  path: string;
  /**Standard Information Modified timestamp */
  last_modified: string;
  /**Full path to the Registry key */
  key_path: string;
  /**Path to the Registry file */
  source_path: string;
}
