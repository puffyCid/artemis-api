# Collection Options

- `alt_file` Full path to alternative NTUSER.DAT Registry file. This
  configuration is **optional**. By default artemis will parse UserAssist for

  attempt to parse the SYSTEM hive to lookup folder descriptions. This
  configuration is **optional**. Default is **false**.

```typescript
export interface UserAssist {
  /**Path of executed application */
  path: string;
  /**Last execution time of application */
  last_execution: string;
  /**Number of times executed */
  count: number;
  /**Registry path to UserAssist entry */
  reg_path: string;
  /**ROT13 encoded path */
