# RecycleBin

Windows `RecycleBin` is a special folder on Windows that stores files deleted
using the Explorer GUI. When a file is deleted (via Explorer) two types files
are generated in the `RecycleBin`:

- Files that begin with `$I<number>.<original extension>`. Contains metadata
  about deleted file
- Files that begin with `$R<number>.<original extension>`. Contents of deleted
  file

Currently artemis supports parsing the `$I` based files using the standard
Windows APIs to read the file for parsing. It does not try to recover files that
have been deleted/emptied from the `RecycleBin`

Other parsers:

- [Velociraptor](https://docs.velociraptor.app/artifact_references/pages/windows.forensics.recyclebin/)

# alt_file = "C:\\Artifacts\\$IAC12F"
```

# Collection Options

- `alt_file` Full path to alternative RecycleBin file. This configuration is
  **optional**. By default artemis will parse all RecycleBin files on the system

# Output Structure

An array of `RecycleBin` entries

```typescript
export interface RecycleBin {
  /**Size of deleted file */
  size: number;
  /**Deleted timestamp of file */
  deleted: string;
  /**Name of deleted file */
  filename: string;
  /**Full path to the deleted file */
  full_path: string;
  /**Directory associated with deleted file */
  directory: string;
  /**SID associated with the deleted file */
  sid: string;
  /**Path to the file in the Recycle Bin */
  recycle_path: string;
}
```
