# UnifiedLogs

macOS `unifiedlogs` are the primary files associated with logging system
activity. They are stored in a binary format at `/var/db/diagnostics/`.

Other Parsers:

- [UnifiedLogReader](https://github.com/ydkhatri/UnifiedLogReader) (Only partial
  support)

# TOML Collection

```toml
system = "macos"

[output]
name = "unifiedlogs_collection"
directory = "./tmp"
format = "json"
compress = false
endpoint_id = "abdc"
collection_id = 1
output = "local"

[[artifacts]]
artifact_name = "unifiedlogs"
[artifacts.unifiedlogs]
sources = ["Special"]
# Optional
# logarchive_path = ""
```

# Collection Options

- `sources` List of directories that should be included when parsing the
  `unifiedlogs`. These directories are found at `/var/db/diagnostics/`. Only the
  following directories contain logs:
  - Persist
  - Special
  - Signpost
  - HighVolume
- `logarchive_path` Path to a logarchive formatted directory. This configuration
  is **optional**

To parse all logs you would use
`sources = ["Special", "Persist", "Signpost", "HighVolume"]`
