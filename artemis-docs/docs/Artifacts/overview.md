# Artifacts Overview

Artemis supports over 100 different types of artifacts! All of these artifacts
can be collected from a TOML collection or from simple TypeScript code.

In addition, custom artifacts can be created using TypeScript by using the
Artemis API.  
See [API Overview](../API/overview.md) for more details.

A breakdown of artifacts by OS is below.

| OS                                | Number of Artifacts |
