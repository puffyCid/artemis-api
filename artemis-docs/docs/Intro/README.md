# Introduction

Artemis is a powerful command line digital forensic and incident response (DFIR)
tool that collects forensic data from Windows, macOS, and Linux endpoints. Its
primary focus is: speed, ease of use, and low resource usage.

Notable features _so far_:

- Setup collections using basic TOML files
- Parsing support for large amount of forensic artifacts (40+)
- Output to JSON or JSONL or CSV file(s)
- Can output results to local system or upload to cloud services.
- Embedded JavaScript runtime via [Boa](https://boajs.dev/)

The goal of this site is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to use artemis.
