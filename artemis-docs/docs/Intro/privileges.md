# Privileges

The goal for artemis is to parse endpoint forensic artifacts. Many of these
artifacts can only be accessed with elevated privileges. If you try running
artemis as a standard user, depending on what you want to collect you will
encounter permission errors.

The `artemis-core` library **does not** _directly_<sup>*</sup> modify anything
on disk. It only writes results to a file if specified in the TOML collection.

## <sup>*</sup> Modifying Data

The main goal of most endpoint based live forensic tools is to collect data and
not change anything on the endpoint. By not directly modifying files on disk we
can accomplish most of this goal.

_However_, simply running a program on a computer can cause indirect changes to
the OS that are outside of our control. Some of these indirect changes can
include:

- Allocating and deallocting memory
- Logs generated by the OS when an application is executed
- Analytics generated by the OS when an application is executed
- Access timestamps are changed when opening a file for reading

Despite these indirect changes we should still be comfortable that the endpoint
data collected by the `artemis-core` library was not directly modified by
`artemis-core` and if we run a different program that program should get the
same results as `artemis-core` (disregarding any changes made by the OS)
